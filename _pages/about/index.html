<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi, I’m Arushi Gupta, a senior at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) studying computer science. I am broadly interested in using machine learning to improve healthcare and accelerate scientific discovery. In the past, I’ve developed machine learning methods, particularly in computer vision, to address problems in ecology, medical imaging, surgical training, and single-cell biology. Most recently, I created a multi-modal method using verbal feedback and surgical video to automatically predict the effectiveness of surgical feedback.</p> <p>Throughout my undergraduate research career, I am grateful to have worked with Prof. <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Anima Anandkumar</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.vision.caltech.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pietro Perona</a> at Caltech, Dr. <a href="https://www.alexluresearch.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alex Lu</a> at Microsoft Research, Dr. <a href="https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Andrew.Hung" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Andrew Hung</a> at Cedars-Sinai, and Prof. <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/shreyas-vasanawala" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shreyas Vasanawala</a> at Stanford.</p> </body></html>
