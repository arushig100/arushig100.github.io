I am an incoming PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. I recently graduated from the California Institute of Technology, where my research focused on developing **machine learning** methods, particularly in computer vision, to address critical challenges in **healthcare** and drive **scientific discovery**. My past work includes creating methods to predict the effectiveness of surgical feedback, accelerate MRI reconstruction for high-dimensional imaging, and evaluate the robustness of single-cell image representation models.

Throughout my undergraduate research career, I am grateful to have worked with Prof. [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) and Prof. [Pietro Perona](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/) from Caltech, Dr. [Alex Lu](https://www.alexluresearch.com/) from Microsoft Research, Dr. [Andrew Hung](https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Andrew.Hung) from Cedars-Sinai, and Prof. [Shreyas Vasanawala](https://profiles.stanford.edu/shreyas-vasanawala) from Stanford.
