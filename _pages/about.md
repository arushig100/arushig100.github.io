Hi, I’m Arushi Gupta, a senior at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) studying computer science. I am broadly interested in using machine learning to improve healthcare and accelerate scientific discovery.  In the past, I’ve developed machine learning methods, particularly in computer vision, to address problems in ecology, medical imaging, surgical training, and single-cell biology. Most recently, I created a multi-modal method using verbal feedback and surgical video to automatically predict the effectiveness of surgical feedback.
